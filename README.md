# Hacktoberfest 2020

This is a repository containing simple competitive coding problems, aimed at newbie developers to get started with Open Source and Github. You can solve the problems using any language of your choice, and submit it as a pull request.

You can also add your own questions and solutions as you wish. Please make sure that you organize the files using folders with appropriate names. Add the questions on a Markdown file using proper formatting, like the rest of the questions in the repo.

If you have any questions or queries, please create an issue. Or contact mozillasjcet@protonmail.com  
We're always happy to help :)))

May the FOSS be with you! âš¡
